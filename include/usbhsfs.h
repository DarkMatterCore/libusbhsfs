 * These functions make it possible to retrieve information on demand about the available UMS   *
 * filesystems that have been mounted as virtual devoptab devices, using a background thread    *
 * created by the user.                                                                         *

 * This background thread can create a Waiter object using the UEvent object returned by        *
 * usbHsFsGetStatusChangeUserEvent(), which can then be used with primitive waiting operations  *
 * such as waitMulti() or waitObjects(). This is specially useful for applications that rely on *
 * other Switch-specific ABIs that are also event-driven: a single background thread can be     *
 * dedicated to handle multiple types of events, including the UMS event provided here.         *
 *                                                                                              *
 * Even though simultaneous usage of both event-based and callback-based systems should be      *
 * possible, it is heavily discouraged.                                                         *
