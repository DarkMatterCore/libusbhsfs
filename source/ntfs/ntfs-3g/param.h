/*
 *		Permission checking modes for high level and low level
 *
 *	The choices for high and low lowel are independent, they have
 *	no effect on the library
 *
 *	Stick to the recommended values unless you understand the consequences
 *	on protection and performances. Use of cacheing is good for
 *	performances, but bad on security with internal fuse or external
 *	fuse older than 2.8
 *
 *	On Linux, cacheing is discouraged for the high level interface
 *	in order to get proper support of hard links. As a consequence,
 *	having access control in the file system leads to fewer requests
 *	to the file system and fewer context switches.
 *
 *	Possible values for high level :
 *		1 : no cache, kernel control (recommended)
 *		4 : no cache, file system control
 *		6 : kernel/fuse cache, file system control (OpenIndiana only)
 *		7 : no cache, kernel control for ACLs
 *
 *	Possible values for low level :
 *		2 : no cache, kernel control
 *		3 : use kernel/fuse cache, kernel control  (recommended)
 *		5 : no cache, file system control
 *		6 : kernel/fuse cache, file system control (OpenIndiana only)
 *		8 : no cache, kernel control for ACLs
 *		9 : kernel/fuse cache, kernel control for ACLs (target)
 *
 *	Use of options 7, 8 and 9 requires a fuse module upgrade
 *	When Posix ACLs are selected in the configure options, a value
 *	of 6 is added in the mount report.
